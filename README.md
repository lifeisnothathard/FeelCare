Project Title:
FeelCare: The pharmacy for your wellness

Problem Statement:
Despite the increasing availability of digital tools and growing awareness of mental well-being, individuals often struggle to consistently and effectively track their moods in a way that yields meaningful insights and translates into positive behavioral changes. This suggests a gap between the potential benefits of mood tracking and the actual experiences of users, indicating that current solutions may not fully address the underlying needs and challenges associated with this practice


Suggested solution:
FeelCare is designed to keep track of your well being throughout the week. Tracking emotions helps you understand what you’re feeling and why. It can be useful tool for managing your feelings.

Technologies used:
1. Hive / Shared preferences - to store data in user's device
2. Flutter local notifications - to make push notifications
3. Firebase_auth - to manage user authentication 
4. In-app mood widget 

Processes in the app:
 1. User authentication
2. Log-in, summary of mood for the past weeks
3. Choose mood of the day
4. Set new habit for the month
 5. Get advice of the day
6. Reminder notification to continue habit streak/choose mood
